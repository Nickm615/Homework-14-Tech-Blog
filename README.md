This assignment was so brutal. I have a lot of required functionality there but there is still a lot that needs to be added. Right now here is what is working:
Server runs on localhost
Routes correctly to homepage and displays seeded posts using the post details partial
nav links redirect to login screen if user is not logged in
routes to create user and login work, and update the session accordingly
The page displays the logout option if user is logged in and that option logs the user out and sets session variable to false
I'm so close to having comments working I just couldn't quite get there. All the functionality is there I just need a little more time bug hunting to get it actually working.6

The large issue is that while this app works on my local host it does not display any posts when live on heroku. I don't know why, maybe it doesn't have access to my local databases? I don't know how to fix this issue. Here is a link to an example video: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/C6Uc614jBt6kN7JNp5zy
